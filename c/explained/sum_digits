 explanation for the algorithm used in sum_digits


    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <math.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    int main() {
      int n;
      scanf("%d", &n);
      int sum = 0;
      while (n != 0) {
        sum += n % 10;
        n = n / 10;
      }
      printf("%d", sum);
      return 0;
    }

first i scan from stdin the number i want to sum it's digits.
then i use the modulo operator to get the value of it's last
digit (only modulo by ten will give us the last digit).
after that, i just divide the number by ten (using the conventional
division operator, because it will round the number)
then i just repeat the proccess, adding the value of each
last digit of the generated numbers
